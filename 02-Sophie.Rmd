# Sophie

## Sophie was a Black Labrador Retriever.

<p>She loved to fetch balls and play "goalie" between the kitchen doors.<br>
Because she was a Labrador Retriever, her nature was to be loving and protecting.</p>

<p>Sophie was there for the woman when she moved to the new country.<br>
Sophie was a constant companion, and never let the woman feel alone even when the new country felt strange.<br>
When the woman had children, Sophie loved them and was patient and gentle - even when the children pulled on her tail.<br>
Sophie taught the children what it means to be loved by a dog.</p>

<p>The woman loved Sophie when she was a puppy with fur as black as coal.<br>
The woman loved Sophie more and more each year - even as she saw the sprinkles of gray grow around her nose and face.<br>
The woman learned from Sophie that old dogs should get whatever they want.</p>

<p>When Sophie died, the woman and her husband buried her under a dogwood tree.</p>
