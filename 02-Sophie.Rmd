# Sophie

Sophie was a Black Labrador Retriever.
She loved to fetch balls and play "goalie" between the kitchen doors.

Because she was a Labrador Retriever, her nature was to be loving and protecting.

Sophie was there for the woman who moved to the new country.
Sophie was a constant companion, and never let the woman feel alone even when the new country felt strange.
When the woman had children, Sophie loved them and was patient and gentle - even when the children pulled on her tail.
Sophie taught the children what it means to be loved by a dog.

The woman loved Sophie when she was a puppy with fur as black as coal.
The woman loved Sophie more and more each year - even as she saw the sprinkles of gray grow around her nose and face.
The woman learned from Sophie that old dogs should get whatever they want.

When Sophie died, the woman and her husband buried her under a dogwood tree.
