# Dewey

## Dewey is an English Setter.

<p>He loves to chase balls and toys and then play "keep away".<br>
When he gets excited and happy he bounces on his front legs.</p>

<p>Because Dewey is an English Setter, his nature is to be OCD and quite crazy.</p>

<p>When the woman's daughter was having trouble with pandemic lock downs and missing the dog Sophie,<br>
Dewey magically appeared into the life of the family and brought joy - and very sharp puppy teeth.</p>

<p>Dewey teaches the woman to be patient, and that love is more important than having unchewed rugs.<br>
Dewey teaches the woman's husband to be patient, and that no matter how many patches made, there is always another hole to find under the fence.<br>
Dewey teaches the family that when you need affection, you should speak up and bark until someone pulls you into their arms.<br>
Dewey teaches the family that snuggles are so important, and the best way to hug is to lean in with your whole heart.</p>
