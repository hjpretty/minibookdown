Tinker was an Irish Setter.

He was red and big and loved to chase sticks and his red ball.
Because he was an Irish Setter, his nature was to be a bit crazy and goofy.

He showed the girl what it was to have love from a dog.
When she was young, she would place her head between his front paws when he was laying down, and would feel oh so safe.

When Tinker died, the girl found a place to be alone to mourn his loss.
The girl vowed she would someday have a dog to show her children what it is to have love from a dog.
