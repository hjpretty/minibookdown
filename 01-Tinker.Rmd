# Tinker

## Tinker was an Irish Setter.

<p>He was red and big and loved to chase sticks and his red ball.<br>
Because he was an Irish Setter, his nature was to be a bit crazy and goofy.</p>

<p>He showed the girl what it was to have love from a dog.<br>
When she was young, she would place her head between his front paws when he was laying down, and would feel oh so safe.</p>

<p>When Tinker died, the girl found a place to be alone to mourn his loss.<br>
The girl vowed she would someday have another dog to show her children what it is to have love from a dog.</p>
