Because he was an Irish Setter, his nature was to be a bit crazy and goofy. He showed the girl what it was to have love from a dog. When she was young, she would place her head between his front paws when he was laying down, and would feel oh so safe. When Tinker died, the girl found a place to be alone to mourn his loss. The girl vowed she would someday have another dog to show her children what it is to have love from a dog.

When he gets excited and happy he bounces on his front legs. Because Dewey is an English Setter, his nature is to be OCD and quite crazy. When the woman’s daughter was having trouble with pandemic lock downs and missing the dog Sophie, Dewey magically appeared into the life of the family and brought joy - and very sharp puppy teeth. Dewey teaches the woman to be patient, and that love is more important than having unchewed rugs. Dewey teaches the woman’s husband to be patient, and that no matter how many patches made, there is always another hole to find under the fence. Dewey teaches the family that when you need affection, you should speak up and bark until someone pulls you into their arms. Dewey teaches the family that snuggles are so important, and the best way to hug is to lean in with your whole heart.
